3. **Export** your cookies in Netscape format (`.txt` file)
4. **Click** on the "🍪 ⬆️ cookies.txt" button at the top left of the application
5. **Select** your `cookies.txt` file
6. **Test** with your private playlist

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Never share your cookies.txt file, it contains your login credentials!

### ⚠️ Tips

## ❓ Common Issues

### "The playlist does not exist"

**Possible causes:**

1. The playlist is **private** → Make sure you're logged into YouTube in Firefox, or provide a `cookies.txt` file
2. The URL is incorrect → Check that you've copied the complete playlist URL
3. The playlist was deleted → Verify it still exists on YouTube

### "ERROR: unable to download video data"

**Possible causes:**

1. Unstable internet connection
2. Deleted or private video
3. YouTube changed its format → Update yt-dlp: `pip install -U yt-dlp`

### Slow download

- **Solutions:**
  - ✅ Check your internet connection 📶
  - ✅ YouTube sometimes limits speed based on your location
  - ✅ Try downloading at a different time
  - ✅ Download a lower resolution (720p instead of 1080p)

### MP3 conversion error

**Error**: `ERROR: ffmpeg not found`

**Solution**: MP3 conversion requires **FFmpeg** installed on your system.

**Installing FFmpeg:**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Fedora
sudo dnf install ffmpeg

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg
```

**Verify installation:**

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

### Download stops at 99%

This is normal! The application is **merging** video and audio (or converting to MP3). This step can take from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on:

- File size
- Your computer's power
- Chosen resolution

> 💡 **Tip**: Don't close the application while the progress bar is at 99%!

### "Permission denied" during download

**Possible causes:**

1. The destination folder is write-protected
2. A file with the same name is already open
3. Your antivirus is blocking writes

**Solutions:**

- ✅ Choose a folder in your home directory (Documents, Downloads)
- ✅ Close any open video files
- ✅ Add an exception in your antivirus
